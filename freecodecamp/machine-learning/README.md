# Machine Learning

## What is machine learning

Machine programs to abalyze data and make intelligent predicitions without hardcoding it.

data --> algorithm --> predicition

x --> y

- x is the input feature 
- y is the output feature

case scenario: predict house price

size of house -> price of house

f(x) --> y

f(x1, x2, x3, ...) -> y


0) a function that maps your input variables to the output variable

1) machine learning is the field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn - Arthur Samuel


2) a computer program issaid to learn from experience E with with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measure by P improves with experice E - Tom Mitchell

Case scenario: email spam detection system

variables:
 - T =  0 / 1 (if spam or not)
 - E = experience of the prediction
 - P = performance of the prediction 

Problem: Spam detection system
- train algorithm which is a function => f(x) <------
- evaluate                                          |
- luauch system                                     |
- else error analysis -------------------------------


House Price Prediction

size of the house --> price of the house
                x --> y


what is data?

 


### Supervised Learning

- regression

  - coniuous value

- classification

  - discrete value


### Unsupervised Learning
